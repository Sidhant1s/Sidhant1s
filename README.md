# 🧠 Sidhant Negi – Cybersecurity Researcher

I build offensive and defensive cyber models targeting Tier-1 adversaries, with a focus on privacy protocols, worm-based endpoint surveillance, and passive space signal detection.

### 🔍 Key Projects

* 🪱 **[Worm-Assisted Surveillance on Monero](https://github.com/Sidhant1s/monero-worm-surveillance)**
  A Tier-1 adversary model using entropy filtering, behavioral probes, and OS-level worms to trace XMR receivers.

* 🛡️ **[Healthy Spy – AI Safety Trigger Agent](https://github.com/Sidhant1s/healthy-spy)**
  Privacy-first emergency assistant that activates recording & alert based on biometric/motion anomalies.

* 🛡️ **Passive Satellite Signal Defense & Triangulation System (PSSDTS)(https://github.com/Sidhant1s/satellite-signal-defense)**  
A conceptual defense system to passively detect and localize unauthorized satellite signals using AI-driven triangulation and radar grid analysis. Submitted to PMO India for review.
